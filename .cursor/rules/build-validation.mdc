# Build and Validation Guidelines

## CMake Configuration

- All build configurations MUST be in `@cmake/`
- Use modern CMake practices (target-based configuration)
- Maintain separate configuration for each platform
- Document all custom build steps

## Build Requirements

- All code MUST compile without warnings
- Enable and respect warning levels:
  - `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` for GCC/Clang
  - `/W4 /WX` for MSVC
- Maintain compatibility with:
  - Latest Xcode for macOS
  - Visual Studio for Windows
  - CMake for cross-platform

## Testing Standards

- Unit tests required for all new features
- Integration tests for platform interfaces
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Document test coverage requirements

## Validation Procedures

- Run platform-specific tests before commits
- Validate cross-platform compatibility
- Check documentation completeness
- Verify API compatibility

## Documentation Requirements

- Update README.md for major changes
- Document build requirements in `@docs/`
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation
- Include troubleshooting guides

## Continuous Integration

- Pass all CI/CD pipeline checks
- Maintain build matrices for platforms
- Regular validation of cross-platform builds
- Performance regression testing
